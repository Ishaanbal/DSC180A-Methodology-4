## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the concept of digital twins as an intersection of data science and healthcare. Digital twins represent powerful computational models that can simulate how diseases, treatments, and interventions affect individual patients or entire populations. The ability to create these sophisticated patient models demonstrates how far computational power has advanced and opens exciting possibilities for personalized medicine and population health management.

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For Quarter 2, I would like to explore a digital twin project that builds upon my previous experience with patient outcome predictions and treatment cost burden analysis from prior internships. While I have worked on predictive modeling for healthcare outcomes, a digital twin approach would allow me to tackle more complex, dynamic simulations that integrate multiple data sources and patient characteristics. This represents an opportunity to work on something technically challenging while addressing a meaningful problem in healthcare that I find genuinely interesting.

### **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make to my Quarter 1 project approach concerns the data acquisition strategy. Currently, I plan to pull data from PubMed, but I anticipate challenges in refining the appropriate search terms and filters to extract relevant and useful information. The difficulty lies in balancing specificity and breadth—too narrow a search may miss important papers, while too broad a search could return overwhelming amounts of less relevant literature. I would explore alternative or complementary data sources and develop more systematic methods for validating the relevance of retrieved papers.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be particularly interested in incorporating medical image processing techniques into my project. Working with healthcare imaging data to build predictive tools for patient conditions would combine computer vision with clinical applications in a compelling way. Medical imaging offers rich, high-dimensional data that could enhance prediction models beyond traditional structured clinical data. Developing a tool that can analyze medical images to help predict patient conditions or outcomes would represent both a technical challenge and a meaningful contribution to clinical decision support.
